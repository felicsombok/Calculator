# - "+": Add first_number and second_number
# - "-": Subtract second_number from first_number
# - "*": Multiply first_number by second_number
# - "/": FLoor-divide first_number by second_number (use //)
# - "%": Find the remainder of dividing first_number by
#        second_number

#Notice that for division, we're asking you to use floor
#division to avoid worrying about rounding errors.`

##If the operation is not one of the five listed above, print
